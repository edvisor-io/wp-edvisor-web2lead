####Javascript
- Don't touch if you're not sure what you're doing. Contact Edvisor if you need help.
- There are two text areas for Javascript.
- 'General' will be applied before the code will run. Here you can inject code into the form.
- 'Before Post' will be applied right before it makes the AJAX POST. Here you can change the data before it gets posted to the Edvisor API. You can change the data by access the variable 'data' object.
